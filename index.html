                    The gambling/casino-related ads were so dominating the auctions for these new ad slots that they were even being presented at the bottom of the product pages for apps intended to help people with gambling addiction. Other scumminess included ads for “psychic”
                    apps on the product page for Disney+ and ads for hookup dating apps on the pages for marriage counseling apps. You really couldn’t make this stuff up.
                    <br /><br /> Within one day of the new ad slots going live, Apple issued a terse statement: We have paused ads related to gambling and a few other categories on App Store product pages. It’s now nearly a week later, and the gambling/hookup/psychic-type
                    ads still don’t seem to be showing up (well, mostly), but it’s also just as hard to see why Apple is selling these spots in the first place. Well, duh, for the money, yes — that’s obviously the only plausible answer. But how much money
                    can these ads be generating? How much can Apple hope they eventually generate? It can’t possibly be enough money to justify the damage it’s doing to Apple’s brand. These App Store ads are like the “Intel Inside” stickers on PC laptops — they’re
                    worth money, but the money’s not worth it. Who’s laughing about those stickers now? “No ads in the App Store, period” would have been a powerful, appealing message. <br /><br /> One that Apple could have used to justify its control
                    over all software on the platform and its much-debated mandatory cut of all app and game transactions. “We sell ads in the App Store, but they’re OK because they don’t track you” seems to be the message Apple is going for, but that’s
                    neither powerful nor appealing. It boils down to “Hey, it could be worse.”

                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    I was reminded of that last week, when I saw this exchange on Reddit in a thread about these new App Store ad units: sisco98: “Today tab, which until now has only displayed content handpicked from the App Store’s editorial staff, without any paid placement.”
                    Up to now, I was pretty sure these picks were paid by developers. spack12: Yeah I always figured those were ads too. rotates-potatoes: Probably why they created the ad unit. If everyone’s going to assume it’s paid ads, might as well
                    collect revenue from it. Many years ago I had an app featured in the app store. Was awesome, like 10× sales overnight. Was a complete surprise to me when it happened.

                    Apple is actually scrupulous about labeling paid placements as “ads”, and using different background colors for them. One can certainly argue that ads should be even more clearly demarcated, but if you look for it, it’s always clear. But people don’t
                    look. If the message were clear that there are no ads or paid placements in the App Store, period people might learn. But if the message is that there are ads, but not many, but now there are more than there used to be, and but if
                    you look closely you’ll see that the ads have a blue background and a small “ad” label almost everyone is going to assume that anything that might be an ad is an ad and the whole App Store is pay-for-play all the way down. <br
                    /><br /> Back in 2014, the front page of the Privacy section on Apple’s website was an open letter, signed simply by “Tim”. Here’s an archived version from The Internet Archive; here’s one from Archive.today. Cook’s letter read in
                    part:
                    <br />
                    <br /> A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you’re not the customer. You’re the product. But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn’t come at the expense
                    of your privacy. Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t “monetize” the information you store
                    on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple.
                </p>

            <h2>Final</h2>
    
            <p> <br /> Apple’s commitment to privacy is no less today than it was then. One can well argue that it’s even stronger. But there are aspects of Apple’s position on advertising eight years ago, unrelated to privacy, that don’t square with Apple’s
                position today. Cook has repeated variations of that “you’re not the customer, you’re the product” mantra umpteen times since 2014. But how are these ads in the App Store not making users the product, and advertisers the customers? It remains
                true that Apple is not monetizing the information we store on our devices or in iCloud, but they’re clearly monetizing our attention and their exclusive hold on that attention for all apps and games for iOS. Apple’s business model is no longer
                the straightforward selling of great products, and these new ads in the App Store are not designed to make anything better other than Apple’s Services bottom line.
